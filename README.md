## 📊 The Eisenhower Matrix

The app organizes tasks into four strategic quadrants:

1. **🔥 DO FIRST** (Urgent + Important)
   - Crises, deadlines, critical decisions
   - Handle immediately for maximum impact

2. **📅 SCHEDULE** (Not Urgent + Important)
   - Long-term goals, planning, skill development
   - Block time in your calendar for these

3. **👥 DELEGATE** (Urgent + Not Important)
   - Interruptions, routine tasks, minor issues
   - Assign to others when possible

4. **🗑️ ELIMINATE** (Not Urgent + Not Important)
   - Distractions, busywork, low-value activities
   - Minimize or remove entirely

## 📚 Productivity Best Practices

### Effective Usage Patterns
1. **Start Small**: Begin with 3-5 tasks per quadrant to avoid overwhelm
2. **Daily Review**: Spend 10 minutes each morning reorganizing priorities
3. **Quadrant Focus**: Tackle "Do First" tasks immediately, schedule "Schedule" items
4. **Delegate Actively**: Move "Delegate" tasks to others whenever possible
5. **Eliminate Ruthlessly**: Question every "Eliminate" task's necessity

### Eisenhower Principles
- **Urgency ≠ Importance**: Distinguish between pressing and meaningful work
- **Prevention over Crisis**: Invest in important tasks before they become urgent
- **Focus on Impact**: Prioritize tasks that align with your goals and values
- **Time Boxing**: Allocate specific time slots for scheduled activities
- **Regular Maintenance**: Weekly reviews to keep your matrix current
